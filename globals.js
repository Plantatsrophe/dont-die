The battle has gone on for so long that no one remembers who started it. So many generations have passed, knowing only war and violence, that the idea of peace is an unknown concept. Man and bot are at each other's throats and circuit boards over the future of the planet. Neither side knows what they will do if they win, only that they must come out victorious...

This is where HotDog and Fudge have ended up after a quick trip in the time rift went terribly wrong...

Now they must find their way back through time and make it to the show...

If there even is a show anymore...`;
